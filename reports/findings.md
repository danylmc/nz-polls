## Detailed Findings

### 1. Polling Volatility by Election Cycle

**Overall Volatility (Standard Deviation):**

| Party | Mean | Std Dev |
|-------|------|---------|
| National | 41.4% | 8.7% |
| Labour | 35.1% | 7.5% |
| Green | 8.7% | 3.3% |
| ACT | 4.0% | 4.1% |
| NZ First | 5.0% | 3.3% |

**Election Proximity Effect:** Higher volatility near election
- Early campaign volatility: 8.6%
- Late campaign volatility: 9.1%
- Statistical significance: p = 0.3214

### 2. Mean Reversion Analysis

**Autocorrelation (persistence of polling levels):**

- National: Lag-1 = 0.90, Lag-2 = 0.91
- Labour: Lag-1 = 0.90, Lag-2 = 0.88

*Positive autocorrelation indicates polling levels persist over time.*

**Extreme Poll Reversion:**
- National: 68% of outlier polls regress toward mean (125 extreme polls)
- Labour: 66% of outlier polls regress toward mean (115 extreme polls)

### 3. National-Labour Zero-Sum Relationship

**Level Correlation:** r = -0.508 (p = 0.000000)
**Change Correlation:** r = -0.316 (p = 0.000000)

*Interpretation:* Changes are inversely related

### 4. Third Party Squeeze Effect

**Regression: Minor Party Support ~ Days to Election**
- Coefficient: -0.0002 (per day)
- p-value: 0.7480
- R-squared: 0.000

**Early vs Late Campaign:**
- Minor party support (>90 days out): 17.6%
- Minor party support (<30 days out): 19.3%
- Difference: -1.6% (p = 0.0359)

*Interpretation:* No significant third party squeeze detected

### 5. MMP Transition Effect

**National:** Pre-MMP std = 6.4%, Post-MMP std = 8.7%
**Labour:** Pre-MMP std = 4.3%, Post-MMP std = 7.5%

**Minor Party Growth under MMP:** Mean combined support = 18.6%

### 6. Momentum Effects

**National:** Change autocorrelation = -0.512 (p = 0.0000)
- Reversal effect - gains predict losses
**Labour:** Change autocorrelation = -0.447 (p = 0.0000)
- Reversal effect - gains predict losses

### 7. Economic Voting

**Correlations with Incumbent Support:**

- Gdp Growth: r = -0.116 (p = 0.7344, n = 11)
- Unemployment Rate: r = -0.251 (p = 0.4575, n = 11)
- Cpi Inflation: r = 0.014 (p = 0.9684, n = 11)

**Multiple Regression (R² = 0.083):**
- GDP Growth: coef = 0.119, p = 0.9357
- Unemployment: coef = -1.247, p = 0.5023
- Inflation: coef = -0.573, p = 0.7487

### 8. Event Studies

**Leadership Changes:**

| Date | Event | National Change | Labour Change |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| 2017-08-01 | Little → Ardern | -2.1% | +8.9% |

**Crises:**

- **Christchurch earthquake** (2011-02-22): National -1.0%, Labour +0.8%
- **Delta outbreak, second lockdown** (2021-08-17): National -4.5%, Labour +1.6%

## Comparison with Political Science Literature

### Expected vs. Observed Findings

| Hypothesis | Expected | Observed | Confirmed? |
|------------|----------|----------|------------|
| National-Labour negative correlation | Strong negative | r = -0.316 | Yes |
| Third party squeeze near elections | Support declines | Coef = -0.0002 | No |
| Mean reversion of outliers | Outliers regress | N/A% revert | Unclear |
