## 4. Statistical Patterns from Our Analysis

These patterns, confirmed across 1,016 polls (1993-2026), constrain what future trajectories are plausible.

### Confirmed Predictive Patterns

| Pattern | Evidence | Implication for 2026 |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **National-Labour zero-sum** | r = -0.316, p < 0.001 | Labour gains come partly at National's expense and vice versa |
| **Mean reversion** | 68% of extreme polls revert | National's decline from ~38% and Labour's rise from ~26% will moderate |
| **Momentum reversal** | r = -0.51, p < 0.001 | Parties that gain tend to lose next period; current trends will slow |
| **Leadership honeymoon** | Ardern: +8.9pp, Collins removal: +7.7pp | No new leaders expected, so no honeymoon effects likely |
| **Scandal spillover** | 60% show zero-sum rival gains | Any scandal benefits the opposing major party |
| **Cumulative damage** | Multiple events in succession compound (r = -0.755) | Coalition infighting risk: multiple events could cascade |

### Patterns Not Detected in NZ Data

| Pattern | Result | Note |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Third-party squeeze** | p = 0.748, not significant | Minor parties may *not* lose support near elections as theory predicts |
| **Economic voting** | Not significant | GDP/unemployment don't reliably predict incumbent polling in NZ (small N) |

## 5. Key Variables to Watch

### High-Impact Factors (based on historical effect sizes)

| Factor | Historical Effect Size | Current Risk/Likelihood |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Leadership change** | +3.6 to +8.9pp | Low -- both leaders appear stable |
| **Coalition infighting** | -2 to -8pp for affected party | Moderate -- three-party coalition inherently fragile |
| **Major crisis event** | +1.6 to +8.9pp for incumbent | Unknown -- exogenous |
| **Scandal** | -0.5 to -3pp for affected party | Moderate -- election year scrutiny increases |
| **Economic trajectory** | Weak in NZ data, but relevant to voter mood | Positive -- recovery underway, rates falling |

### Structural Factors

1. **Incumbent fatigue**: National-led government will be approaching 3 years by election. Literature suggests support erodes after 2+ terms, but this is only term 1.

2. **Coalition complexity**: Three-party coalition (National + ACT + NZ First) creates more points of failure than typical two-party arrangements. NZ First's surge to ~10-12% makes it a powerful coalition partner with potential to disrupt.

3. **MMP threshold dynamics**: Parties near the 5% threshold create uncertainty. ACT at ~7.5% is safe but declining. Te Pati Maori at ~3% needs electorate seats. TOP at ~1.7% is unlikely to enter parliament.

4. **Right direction/wrong direction**: At -16.4 net, voters are dissatisfied with the country's direction. This typically disadvantages the incumbent.

## 6. Scenario Analysis

### Scenario A: Status Quo Drift (Most Likely)

Economic recovery proceeds as forecast. No major scandals or crises. Polls tighten further toward election day as mean reversion and momentum reversal take effect.

- **Outcome**: Right bloc 48-52%, Left bloc 45-49%. Result depends on minor party thresholds and wasted votes. Hung parliament possible.

### Scenario B: Economic Tailwind Benefits Incumbent

GDP recovery accelerates, unemployment falls faster than expected, house prices rise. Consumer confidence continues to improve. Voters credit the government.

- **Outcome**: National stabilises at 33-35%. Coalition maintains narrow majority.

### Scenario C: Coalition Fracture

Internal tensions between National, ACT, and NZ First escalate publicly. NZ First's surging polls embolden Peters to differentiate. Historical pattern shows cumulative infighting events compound (r = -0.755 correlation with polling decline).

- **Outcome**: National drops to 28-30%. NZ First cannibalises coalition vote. Left bloc wins on fragmentation.

### Scenario D: Exogenous Shock

A major domestic crisis or international event occurs. Historical pattern shows rally-round-the-flag effects are real but short-lived (+1.6pp average, fading in ~60 days).

- **Outcome**: Temporary incumbent boost, then reversion. Timing relative to election day is critical.

## 7. Data Sources & Quality Notes

### Polling Data (from project dataset)
- **Party vote**: 82 polls in the 2023-2026 election cycle (scraped from Wikipedia)
- **PM preference**: 51 polls from 5 pollsters (2023-2026)
- **Limitation**: Pollster names are not recorded in party vote data, preventing house-effect analysis
- **Margin of error**: For n=1000, MoE is approximately +/-3.1% at 95% confidence

### Economic Data (from project dataset + web sources)
- **Historical (1961-2024)**: World Bank API (GDP, unemployment, CPI)
- **2025-2026 forecasts**: IMF, OECD, NZ Treasury, RBNZ
- **Limitation**: Only annual resolution for historical data; quarterly would improve precision

### Statistical Analysis (from project reports)
- **Sample**: 1,016 party vote polls (1993-2026), 299 PM polls (2008-2026)
- **Methods**: Pearson correlation, Welch's t-tests, effect sizes (Cohen's d)
- **Reports**: `reports/findings.md`, `reports/scandal_findings.md`
